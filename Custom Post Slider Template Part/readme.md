This is a sample of a template part I wrote using a Bootstrap Slider to display an image, bio, title, and name of Featured Employees using a custom post type. 
This enables the website owner to add/edit/delete people via a custom post type in order to update the slider witout the use of code. 

An Example of this can be seen @ https://springventuregroup.com/about
There is a desktop version and mobile version due to extensive layout changes once mobile is triggered, without messing up the query itself.
